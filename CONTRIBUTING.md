# Contributing

## Overview

To submit changes, create a pull request and fill out the provided template. **Make sure that the pull request title is descriptive.**

## Backend PRs

If you're writing backend code, please include a screenshot of your endpoint(s) working (Postman, Insomnia, etc.). Please also include the URL of your endpoint and any parameters you passed in - this is super helpful for other developers looking to use your endpoint.

## Frontend PRs

If you're writing frontend code, please include a screenshot or screen recording of your new/updated pages.

## Review process

Once submitted, your pull request will require at least one of the tech leads' approval. Additionally, your code will be automatically linted and built using GitHub Actions. This is super important to keep our main branch clean and well-tested. Once the CI checks pass and an approval is given, you're free to merge your PR! 

**Tip:** You can open a *draft PR* to run CI checks before officially submitting your PR for review.

If your pull request is reviewed and not approved, the reviewer will leave some suggestions for changes. (Sometimes we will approve and still leave suggestions). Once you have made your changes, make sure to re-request a review and/or message one of the TLs on Slack to ensure another review.
