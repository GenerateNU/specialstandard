This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the shared config [@antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) to ensure consistent code quality and catch common issues. All code must pass linting before it can be merged into the main branch.

Run the linter:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```
