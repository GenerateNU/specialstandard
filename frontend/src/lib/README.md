# Lib

Utility functions, API clients, or libraries used across the app.

Examples:

-apiClient.ts
-/hooks/\*

## Contribution Guide:

Our schemas and axios client endpoints are generated by [Orval]("https://orval.dev/overview"), based on the existing API spec.

- schemas are in `theSpecialStandardAPI.schema.ts`
- endpoints are split by openapi tag

Thus, it's extremely important to ensure that the OpenAPI spec is up to date and running!

To update the frontend types, run `cd frontend` if not already, then `npx orval`. This uses the existing orval.config.js file, and will update the files accordingly.

Note that TanStack Query hooks will have to be written manually. Orval was too verbose.
